# Interested in Joining?

### Graduate Students:
We do not currently have funding lines to support new graduate students. Students interested in joining us are encouraged to apply to the PhD program in the School of Complex Adaptive Systems, and contact Prof. Cole Mathis about applying for independent funding through the [NSF's Graduate Research Fellowship Program](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/grfp-nsf-graduate-research-fellowship-program) or [NASA Future Investigators in NASA Earth and Space Science Technology](https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/early-career-opportunities/) programs. 

*SESE Graduate Students:*  If you are a newly admitted SESE PhD student, and are interested in a research project with us please email Prof. Cole Mathis. 

### Undergraduate Students:
We support undergraduate students interested in research through the [_Biocomputing Scholars_ program](https://asu-bd-bss.github.io). Barret Honors students interested in thesis projects should email Prof. Cole Mathis directly and/or contact [Prof. Kelle Dhein](https://www.kelledhein.com) for more information about thesis projects in the School of Complex Adaptive Systems.

# About the name

The Mathis Group aims to conduct high quality, reproducible, interdisciplinary research. Research of this nature requires a team with a diverse skill set, and with diverse backgrounds — the most interesting questions cannot be answered by a single mind. The name 'Mathis-Group' does not imply the PI is the only intellectual contributor to the team's success. The name was chosen because it is simple, and unambiguously locates the entire team with the most persistent individual in the group. This is important considering the ever-shifting Arizona State University ecosystem, including the Biodesign Institute, and the School of Complex Adaptive Systems, which have their own idiosyncratic naming conventions.
