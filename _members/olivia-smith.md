I am an early-career scientist excited about the possibility of finding ecosystems elsewhere. I am currently a PhD student in ASU's School of Complex Adaptive Systems. My research interests include agnostic biosignatures, microbial ecology, the emergence of complex ecosystems, and computational and mathematical biology. In my current projects, I use mathematical models to highlight the conditions that underpin biodiversity and stability in microbial ecosystems, as well as the efficient navigation of fitness landscapes via mutation and selection. 

I received a B.S. in biology from the University of New Hampshire, where I pursued additional coursework in physics, data science, and genomics. Some of my noteworthy past research experiences include a Planetary Protection Microbiology internship at [NASA Goddard Space Flight Center](https://etd.gsfc.nasa.gov/partnerships/partnership-opportunities/planetary-protection-flight-facility/), and a mathematical modeling project for human space exploration through [UNH's Quantitative Marine Ecology Lab](https://quantmarineecolab.github.io/). My backround is unique in that I am proficient in both wet lab and dry lab biology methods. 

Aside from my research, I am very passionate about science education. I am currently the Program Director of the [Biocomputing Scholars Program](https://asu-bd-bss.github.io/), which is an undergraduate research program through ASU's Biodesign Center for Biocomputing, Security, and Society. I am also a member of the [Origin of Life Early-career Network (OoLEn)](https://www.oolen.org/about/).
